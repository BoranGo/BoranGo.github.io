# page not found (error 404)

I am sorry for the inconvenience: this server could not find the page that you requested.

Please [contact](/impressum/) me so that I can help you directly,

{% comment %} page.url evaluates to 404.html but not to the page that was requested via GET, so I need to find how liquid can access the current URL (perhaps Javascript instead)
You can search for an [existing page that matches your request](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agoegetap.name+{{ page.url }}i),
{% endcomment %}

or use Google's customized search engine with your own search phrase:
<script async src="https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=6453f12de45eedf6f"></script>
<div class="gcse-search"></div>
