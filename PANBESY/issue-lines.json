A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic of a disease. An influenza pandemic may occur when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity. With the increase in global transport, as well as urbanization and overcrowded conditions in some areas, epidemics due to a new influenza virus are likely to take hold around the world, and become a pandemic faster than before. WHO has defined the phases of a pandemic to provide a global framework to aid countries in pandemic preparedness and response planning. Pandemics *can be either mild or severe* in the illness and death they cause, and the severity of a pandemic can change over the course of that pandemic.{quote}","project":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/project/10738","id":"10738","key":"PANBESY","name":"Pandemic Belief Systems","projectTypeKey":"software","simplified":false,"avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/universal_avatar/view/type/project/avatar/11556","24x24":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/universal_avatar/view/type/project/avatar/11556?size=small","16x16":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/universal_avatar/view/type/project/avatar/11556?size=xsmall","32x32":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/universal_avatar/view/type/project/avatar/11556?size=medium"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10204","id":"10204","description":"Verwaltungsrahmen mit experimenteller Natur","name":"Experimente"}},"issuelinks":[{"id":"18771","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLink/18771","type":{"id":"10443","name":"-1 disruptive Replacement -- style: arrowhead=onormalonormal penwidth=1 color=\"red\" style=dashed","inward":"replaced by ▲","outward":"replaces ▼","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10443"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"17169","key":"PANBESY-15","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/17169","fields":{"summary":"[...] enormous numbers of deaths [...]","status":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/10564","description":"not operational at the moment, but still owned","iconUrl":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/generic.png","name":"retired","id":"10564","statusCategory":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/statuscategory/3","id":3,"key":"done","colorName":"green","name":"Done"}},"issuetype":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issuetype/10679","id":"10679","description":"","iconUrl":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/universal_avatar/view/type/issuetype/avatar/10308?size=medium","name":"Statement","subtask":false,"avatarId":10308,"hierarchyLevel":0}}}},{"id":"18848","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLink/18848","type":{"id":"10409","name":"1 Basis","inward":"supports ▲","outward":"based on ▼","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10409"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"17222","key":"PANBESY-68","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/17222","fields":{"summary":"+","status":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/10572","description":"","iconUrl":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/generic.png","name":"conceived","id":"10572","statusCategory":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/statuscategory/4","id":4,"key":"indeterminate","colorName":"yellow","name":"In Progress"}},"issuetype":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issuetype/10666","id":"10666","description":"technical type for modelling, e.g. to represent \"or\" logic or \"+\" operation","iconUrl":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/universal_avatar/view/type/issuetype/avatar/10300?size=medium","name":"operation","subtask":false,"avatarId":10300,"hierarchyLevel":0}}}},{"id":"18706","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLink/18706","type":{"id":"10439","name":"1 Publication","inward":"publishes ▲","outward":"published by ▼","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10439"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"17171","key":"PANBESY-17","self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/17171","fields":{"summary":"Pandemic preparedness (2009 →)","status":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/10551","description":"","iconUrl":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/images/icons/status_generic.gif","name":"Published","id":"10551","statusCategory":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/statuscategory/4","id":4,"key":"indeterminate","colorName":"yellow","name":"In Progress"}},"issuetype":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issuetype/10608","id":"10608","description":"","iconUrl":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/universal_avatar/view/type/issuetype/avatar/11472?size=medium","name":"Dokument","subtask":false,"avatarId":11472,"hierarchyLevel":0}}}}],"status":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/10551","description":"","iconUrl":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/images/icons/status_generic.gif","name":"Published","id":"10551","statusCategory":{"self":"https://knowhere.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/statuscategory/4","id":4,"key":"indeterminate","colorName":"yellow","name":"In Progress"}}}}
