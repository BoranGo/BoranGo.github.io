<p>I am not vaccinated against the corona virus. Perhaps you are. This could divide us into two different classes of people who can't understand each other.</p>

<p>You could call me a Conspiracy Theorist. I could call you a Conspiracy Denier. Or, we can try to understand each other and continue being friends.</p>

<p>My perspective on this situation is that we <b>adhere to different belief systems</b>.

<p>Some while ago we have chosen to believe in certain assumptions. Since then we keep believing our own belief system. It is unlikely that either of us will change our beliefs. What members of the other belief system call "scientific facts", we refuse as "wrong or unproven assumptions". We even use the same terms and similar logic in our explanations. The <b>difference</b> is just the <b>set of assumptions</b> that we have chosen to believe.</p> 

<p>Fortunately we agree on much more than we, or the media, thought we do.<b/>

<p>I assume that we all believe in, and aspire, health.</b>

<p>In our belief systems we hold different assumptions about what is needed to achieve <i>health</i>. But we do agree on the general concept of health, and that health is an important value.</p>

<p>I guess that we agree on our immune system. At least that it exists and how it used to work.</p>

<p>We do not agree on the <i>corona pandemic</i>. But we do, or once did, agree on the general concept of a pandemic. A pandemic occurs when a (new) virus appears, we have no immunity, then infections of a new desease occur at an exponential rate, causing severe cases and enormous numbers of deaths worldwide.</p>

<p>I guess that until the year 2008 the WHO, you and I agreed on this causal model and definition of a pandemic.</p>

<p>The map to the right highlights these beliefs that we may have, or had, in common. In my eyes this represents <b>a lot of agreement</b>.</p>
