I am not vaccinated against the corona virus. Perhaps you are. This could divide us into two groups of people who can't understand each other.

You could call me a Conspiracy Theorist. I could call you a Conspiracy Denier. Or, we can try to understand each other and continue **being friends**. Fellow humans who inhabit the same wonderful planet. Which is more than enough reason for getting along with each other well. 

If we find ourselves in these two different groups then my perspective on this situation is: we **adhere to different belief systems**. Almost like a religion.

Some while ago we have chosen to believe in certain assumptions. Since then we keep believing our own belief system. It is unlikely that either of us will change our beliefs. What members of one belief system call "scientific facts", the others refuse as "wrong or unproven assumptions". We even share the same terms and similar logic in our explanations. The **difference** is just the **set of assumptions** that we have chosen to believe. 

**Fortunately we agree on much more than we thought we do.**

For example, I assume that we all believe in, and aspire, **health**.

In our belief systems we hold different assumptions about what is needed to achieve *health*. Some people _smoke_. Some _exercise sports_. Some people _smoke and exercise_. We have different approaches to health but we do agree on the general concept of health, and that health is an important value. 

Similar case for **solidarity**. Like every human, we all want to contribute to the wellbeing of our society's members. Based on our own assumptions, we all believe in our own ways of achieving solidarity.

The map to the right highlights some values that we have in common.

We may not agree on the *corona pandemic*. But we do agree on values like **solidarity**, **trust** and **health**.

In my eyes this represents **a lot of agreement**.

I am deeply grateful for all the people in my life who value **friendship** and **human connection** higher than recent medical beliefs. I believe that we must stay united. 

Thank you, my friends!

Revision history

2021-12 first draft (initial title "Pandemic Belief Systems" with more details of my personal opinion about the pandemic question, and therefore less balanced)

2022-07-15 published (new title focussing on friendship, now hopefully well balanced)
