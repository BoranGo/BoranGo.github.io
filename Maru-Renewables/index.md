## annotations

1. what a sailbot is mainly used for: wind powering sails -> boat is sailing... amazingly simple

2. more general case: how does Wind propel the hybrid boat? The previously explored *Sailing* mode is part of this answer. Second, there is a more complex case where wind powers the *Wind Turbine* which charges a battery which later can power the electric engine. And finally there is a somewhat surprising solution: while sailing (in strong wind), the electric engine can recuperate and charge a battery. This electricity can later be used to run the same engine. In total: 3 different ways how to travel by the power of wind.
3. similar question about the other renewable energy source: Solar. Through various solar panels, electricity is generated in various ways. The details don't matter that much. One way or the other, this energy ends up at a 48-Volt battery. Energy can be used immediately (with strong sunshine) or later to power the engine.
4. How can I prepare hot water for a caf√© by sunshine? The most direct way is by using a solar oven such as the *GoSun Go*. No electricity involved.
5. More generally, on board of Maru there are 2 circuits for collecting solar energy into a 12 Volt system and into a 48 Volt system. With 48 Volt I can operate an inverter (230 V) and from that an induction stove, then put an old-school pot with water on that stove. From 12 Volt I can run the *Fusion* solar oven, which also features an electric heating element (besides collecting solar heat directly, such as the *Go*).



*Side note: Sailing is the most expensive way of travelling for free.*
