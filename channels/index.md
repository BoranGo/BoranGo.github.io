## Notes

### Devices

For redundancy (backup) I am using two different Satellite communicator devices (inReach Explore and inReach Mini 2). Both have more or less the same communication features but they are configured to use different [SAT] channels as listed below. Should one device break then I can still send my location and communicate via the other channel(s).

(1) => Explore 
(2), (3) => Mini 2

### Email Gateways

On each device there is an email gateway active.

For the Explore device, I can only send out emails but not receive them. Outgoing Emails include a note "Antworten Sie nicht direkt auf diese Nachricht." It means that you cannot reply by email, but you can use a browser interface for sending text messages to my Explore. It is the same feature that you can also find on the map (1).

For the Mini 2 device, I have a 2-way gateway. This means that I can send and receive Email. You can reply to Emails with the Subject "Mail from Boran". This is channel (3).

- - -

*[SAT]: communication via satellite messenger and Iridium network; very reliable; message delay up to 20 minutes

*[GSM]: based on terrestrial mobile network; reliable if Boran is close to GSM infrastructure (e.g. a few kilometers to nearest shore)

*[proven_]: mature solution with years of successful use

*[new_]: new solution that should be reliable but has not been used for long (by Boran)

*[experimental_]: new solution in test phase; could be changed or dropped in the future
