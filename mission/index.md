# Mission

Helping to Know the Structure of Things

My mission is **helping** clients (people and organizations) to **become aware** of **relevant things** (all types of assets and resources) that **create value** for the **client**.

## What can I contribute?

**Value** is defined by the **client**, sometimes with my help to articulate it.

Most things do not create much value by themselves. Rather they are **connected with other things**, similar to a team or a system, and **create value only together**. We can call this a structure, a composition, a network, a configuration, an architecture or many other terms.

My contribution is: **helping to identify relevant things**.

Becoming aware of an **essential structure** is sometimes hard. Because some connections are invisible or frequently changing.

My contribution is: **discovering such essential structures**.

## How can I help?

Most of the knowledge about things and their structure already exists. The knowledge lives in people or somewhere in the client’s organization. But often that knowledge is partitioned (not connected), or it is remembered (not documented), or it is stored in databases (not readably by humans), or it is kept in documents and not readably by machines.

What I typically do is to transform such pieces of knowledge into a greater body of knowledge. We can call that a configuration model or enterprise continuum or knowledge graph or a quality manamagent system or many other terms.

That service is what I call **knowledge transformation**.

Either way, transformed knowledge shall be more useful for all stakeholders or automation in the client’s organization: for ***daily operation***, for ***strategic communication*** or for ***automated queries***.
