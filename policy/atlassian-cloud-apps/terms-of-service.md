# Terms of Service
## for Cloud Apps in the Atlassian Marketplace

### 1. To begin with
This policy defines the **Terms of Service** when you use our **apps** or the open sourcecode that we use to build them.

The ultimate intention for the apps is to create value. We are passionate about delivering the best possible tools for Knowledge Management.

Legally we are bound by these Terms of Service. By using our app, you agree to the Terms of Service.

“You” means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually.  If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms; (ii) you have read and understand these Terms; and (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent. If you don’t have the legal authority to bind your employer or the applicable entity please do not click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.  PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, THEN (A) YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT SUCH PARTY, (B) YOUR CLICK TO ACCEPT WILL BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND (C) THE WORD “YOU” IN THESE TERMS WILL REFER TO YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY.

### 4. Data Privacy

We are committed to protecting your data privacy, as defined in our [Data Privacy Policy](data-privacy).

By using our app you also agree to our Data Privacy Policy.

### 5. Access to App and Support

Subject to these Terms and during the applicable Subscription Term, you may access and use **our app** for your own business purposes or personal use, as applicable. This right is non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable.

During the Subscription Term, we will provide Support for **our app**, if that app is offered for a fee.

### 6. Fees (via Atlassian)

For those apps that we offer for a fee:

When you install our app then you agree to pay the advertised fee via Atlassian, along with your fee for the Atlassian Cloud Product (e.g. Jira). There is no additional billing or payment between you and us. The same billing cycle and number of users from your Atlassian Product apply to our app.  

Also Atlassian's return policy (30 days refund, no questions asked) applies to our app.

For new apps it is likely that we start with a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) at very low fees and then increase fees while we release versions with larger sets of features. Increased fees will apply no sooner than 60 days after your subscription renews, if you stay on the same user tier. When you change your user tier then our app's new price will be effective.

If you feel like a release with additional features is not worth a higher price, then please contact us. In that case we will continue to offer the previous version of our app at the previous price, and release the version with more features as a separate app. In other words: We will never force you to pay higher fees.

### 7. Warranties and Disclaimer

#### 7.1. Mutual Warranties

Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into these Terms.

#### 7.2. Our Warranties

We warrant, for your benefit only, that we use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent introduction of viruses, Trojan horses or similar harmful materials inour app (but we are not responsible for harmful materials submitted by you or End Users) (the “Performance Warranty”).

#### 7.3. Warranty Remedy

We will use commercially reasonable efforts, at no charge to you, to correct reported non-conformities with the Performance Warranty. If we determine corrections to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term. In this case, you will receive a refund of any fees you have pre-paid for use of the App for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. The Performance Warranty will not apply: (i) unless you make a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which you first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the non-conformity was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party products, software, services or equipment or (iii) to No-Charge Products. Our sole liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for any breach of the Performance Warranty are set forth in this Section 7.

#### 7.4. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 7, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

#### 7.5. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

#### 7.6. Interpretation of Sections 7.4 and 7.5

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

### 8. Publicity Rights

We may identify you as a customer in our promotional materials. We will promptly stop doing so upon your request sent to [office@goegetap.name](mailto:office@goegetap.name) .


### 9. {% include policy_opensource.md %}

You can **not** create your own Atlassian Cloud app based on our source code.

You may however use, or create your own, stand-alone versions of our tools, within the AGPL (see below).

#### 9.1. Open Source Philosophy

We believe in sharing.

Our software tools are designed to manage knowledge, and ultimately to share knowledge.

Sharing our tools is our contribution to empowering people. You may use most of our tools free of charge as stand-alone programs.

_This Atlassian Cloud offering is a convenience service for you, to run our tool smoothly integrated into Jira. We are charging a fee for packaging our tools as Atlassian Cloud apps._

#### 9.2. Open Source License

We provide sourcecode of our app under a [GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
